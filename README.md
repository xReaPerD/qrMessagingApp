# QrAuthMessengerApp

### FriendConnect : a secure QR-based messaging app for personal connections.

The purpose of FriendConnect is to provide 
users with a secure and personal messaging 
experience by using QR code authentication. Unlike 
other messaging apps, FriendConnect focuses on 
building social connections through a more intimate 
and personalized messaging experience. The app is 
designed to protect users from scams and other 
security threats commonly found in popular 
messaging apps, making it a reliable and 
trustworthy option for users looking to connect with 
friends and loved ones. The project aims to 
showcase the potential of QR code authentication 
and its application in the realm of personal 
messaging, while providing a unique and innovative 
solution to address the challenges faced by users in 
traditional messaging apps.

If you plan to utilize the FriendConnect source code, please ensure that you include all necessary Firebase dependencies (As I removed them from build.gradle app) to ensure proper functionality of the app. Thank you for considering FriendConnect for your project needs.
